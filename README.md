# discordbot

i did this project about a few months ago where i built this discord bot

basically it can take a playlist from youtube (i inputted the id from one of mine i made with my personal yt acc) 
but if you wanted to technically you could input any playlist id into it and it should work 
and it generates a random song from that playlist 

anyway it was super simple technically but it took me a long while to figure out the APIs 
since that was my first time working with it 

but i did it! 

the documentation is also not that great here but it should work 

enjoy : )
